\subsection{The Poisson problem}

This problem is chosen for its simplicity, which allows us to focus on the formulation and implementation of the \textit{hp-Adaptive} Discontinuous Galërkin (DG) method without the complexities introduced by more intricate problems. The Poisson equation is a fundamental elliptic partial differential equation that arises in various fields, such as electrostatics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. Its relatively simple form makes it an ideal candidate for testing numerical methods like the DG method, especially when exploring advanced features such as hp-adaptivity.

Consider the domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. The goal is to find $u \in C^2(\Omega)$ such that, for any source function $f \in C(\Omega)$ and boundary condition $g \in C^2(\partial \Omega)$, the following strong form of the Poisson equation holds:

\begin{gather}
    \begin{cases} \label{strong_stokes}
        - \Delta u = f & \Forall \Vector{x} \in \Omega, \\
        u = g & \Forall \Vector{x} \in \partial \Omega.
    \end{cases}
\end{gather}

\subsection{Deriving the Weak Formulation}

We seek $u \in \{v \in V : v \vert_{\partial \Omega} = g \}$ such that, given $f \in V^*$, the following equation is satisfied:

\begin{gather} \label{weak_stokes}
    \boa{u}{v} = \langle f, v \rangle \quad \Forall v \in V,
\end{gather}

where $\boa{\cdot}{\cdot}: V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a bilinear form defined as follows:

\begin{gather}
    \boa{u}{v} = \int_{\Omega} \grad u \cdot \grad v \, d\omega, \label{a}
\end{gather}

The weak formulation is the foundation for numerical approximation methods like the Discontinuous Galërkin method.

\subsection{Interior penalty DG method}

The Interior Penalty DG method is a popular choice for solving elliptic partial differential equations, like the Poisson problem, due to its flexibility in handling complex geometries and its ability to accommodate discontinuities in the solution. Specifically, we employ a symmetric interior penalty method, which balances stability and accuracy by introducing penalty terms that enforce continuity between elements.

Consider a symmetric interior penalty method for this problem, where the objective is to find $ u^k_h \in V^k_h $ such that:

\begin{gather}
    \boa{u^k_h}{v^k_h} = \langle f, v^k_h \rangle \quad \Forall v^k_h \in V^k_h.
\end{gather}

Let $\{\Tau_h\}_h$ be a sequence of polygonal meshes and define $ V^k_h $ as follows:

\begin{gather}
    V^k_h = \left\{ v^k_h \in \LT(\Omega): v^k_h \vert_K \in \PK{k}(K) ~ \Forall K \in \Tau_h \right\},
\end{gather}

it follows that:

\begin{align} 
    \begin{split} \label{boa}
        \boa{v^k_h}{w^k_h} &= \sum_{K \in \Tau_h} \int_K \grad v^k_h \cdot \grad w^k_h ~ d \omega \\
        &- \sum_{F \in \F} \int_F \{\!\!\{ \grad w^k_h \}\!\!\} \cdot \llbracket v^k_h \rrbracket ~ d \sigma  \\
        &- \sum_{F \in \F} \int_F \llbracket w^k_h \rrbracket \cdot \{\!\!\{ \grad v^k_h \}\!\!\} ~ d \sigma \\
        &+ \sum_{F \in \F} \int_F \gamma \llbracket w^k_h \rrbracket \cdot \llbracket v^k_h \rrbracket ~ d \sigma \quad \Forall v^k_h, w^k_h \in V^k_h.
    \end{split}
\end{align}

Despite its advantages, the DG method can be more complex to implement than traditional finite element methods. The formulation involves additional terms, such as jump and average operators, which must be carefully handled.

Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by penalization:

\begin{gather} \label{dirichlet}
    \llbracket u \rrbracket = (u - g) \Vector{n} \quad \Forall F \in \F : F \cap \partial \Omega \neq \emptyset.
\end{gather}

\subsection{Polynomial basis}

Let $\left\{ \phi_i \right\}_{i = 1}^N$ denote a basis for the space $V^k_h$, we then have:

\begin{gather} \label{decomposition}
    u^k_h = \sum_{i = 1}^N \upsilon_i \phi_i \quad \Forall u^k_h \in V^k_h
\end{gather}

so that we aim to find $\Vector{\upsilon} \in \R^N$ such that:

\begin{gather}
    \MA \Vector{\upsilon} = \VB,
\end{gather}

where $\MA \in \R^{N \times N}$ and $\VB \in \R^N$ are defined as:

\begin{align}
    \MA_{ij} &= \boa{\phi_i}{\phi_j}, \label{matrix} \\ 
    \VB_i &= \langle f, \phi_i \rangle. \label{forcing}
\end{align}

The basis of choice will be that of Legendre polynomials.
