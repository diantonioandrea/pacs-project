Tests over a sequence of uniform meshes have been conducted to verify the algorithm's performance, confirming that:

\begin{gather}
    \lVert u - u^k_h \rVert_{\LT(\Omega)} \approx h^{k + 1}, \\
    \lVert u - u^k_h \rVert_{DG} \approx h^k.
\end{gather}

These results were obtained by selecting a smooth function as exact solution such as the following:

\begin{gather}
    u(x, y) = \sin(2 \pi x) \cos(2 \pi y),
\end{gather}

which leads to:

\begin{gather}
    f(x, y) = -\Delta u(x, y) = 8 \pi^2 \sin(2 \pi x) \cos(2 \pi y),
\end{gather}

\subsection{Solutions}

The following shows a scatter plot of the numerical solution $u^k_h$, the exact solution $u$, and the error $|u - u^k_h|$ over the quadrature nodes.
