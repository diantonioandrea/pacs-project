The need for \textit{h-adaptivity} arises from the inefficiency encountered solving the Poisson problem over sequences of uniform meshes while working with pathological exact solutions such as \eqref{pathological_square} and \eqref{pathological_lshape}.

The first step to implement \textit{h-adaptivity} is to evaluate the $\LT$ error on each element and then refine the element with the highest error according to a specific refinement strategy.
