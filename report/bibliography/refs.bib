  abstract = {We present a simple and robust Matlab code for polygonal mesh generation that relies on an implicit description of the domain geometry. The mesh generator can provide, among other things, the input needed for finite element and optimization codes that use linear convex polygons. In topology optimization, polygonal discretizations have been shown not to be susceptible to numerical instabilities such as checkerboard patterns in contrast to lower order triangular and quadrilaterial meshes. Also, the use of polygonal elements makes possible meshing of complicated geometries with a self-contained Matlab code. The main ingredients of the present mesh generator are the implicit description of the domain and the centroidal Voronoi diagrams used for its discretization. The signed distance function provides all the essential information about the domain geometry and offers great flexibility to construct a large class of domains via algebraic expressions. Examples are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the code, which is compact and has fewer than 135 lines.},

  abstract = { We present an a posteriori error estimate of hierarchical type for the mimetic discretization of elliptic problems. Under a saturation assumption, the global reliability and efficiency of the proposed a posteriori estimator are proved. Several numerical experiments assess the actual performance of the local error indicators in driving adaptive mesh refinement algorithms based on different marking strategies. Finally, we analyze and test an inexpensive variant of the proposed error estimator which drastically reduces the overall computational cost of the adaptive procedures. }

  abstract = {We present an hp-adaptive strategy that is based on estimating the decay of the expansion coefficients when a function is expanded in L2-orthogonal polynomials on a triangle or a tetrahedron. We justify this approach by showing that the decay of the coefficients is exponential if and only if the function is analytic. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of this approach, and we compare it with two other hp-adaptive strategies.},
